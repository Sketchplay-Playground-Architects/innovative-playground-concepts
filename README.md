# Innovative Playground Concepts

## Overview

At Sketchplay Playground Architects, we take pride in our creative design process and the final playground installations we deliver. While 3D modeling is crucial to our design workflow, hand-drawn sketches play an essential role. We often sketch on whatever is closest at hand and share screen captures or WhatsApp images to communicate the latest twists and turns in our designs.

We love when our clients share their sketches or ideas, even if they're not seasoned artists. These initial drawings serve as blueprints for refining concepts, ensuring safety and accessibility, and guiding the engineering process.
