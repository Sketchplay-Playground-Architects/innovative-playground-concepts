## Overview

At Sketchplay, we take immense pride in both our creative design process and the final playground installations we deliver. While 3D modeling is crucial to our design workflow, we believe that hand-drawn sketches play an essential role. We often sketch on whatever is closest at hand and share screen captures or WhatsApp images to communicate the latest twists and turns in our designs.

## The Role of Sketches in Playground Design

We love when our clients also share their sketches or ideas, even if they're not seasoned artists. It’s a vital part of our collaborative process, as sketches are the visual language that bridges the designer's imagination with the client’s vision. These initial drawings serve as blueprints for refining concepts, ensuring safety and accessibility, and guiding the engineering process.

## Capturing the Playful Spirit

Our conceptual designs aim to capture the playful spirit and imaginative quality that delight children. We believe that our playgrounds will truly inspire wonder and excitement if our sketches effectively convey a sense of enchantment and fun.
